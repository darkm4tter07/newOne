# API Response using Github Action Workflow

Here in this project we hit an api (https://api.publicapis.org/entries). With using Github Action everytime before pushing the code into main branch that, if api throws the success response (200) then on terminal it will print Success else it will print Error.

Apart from this I've also tried to make an another action that checks every pull request made on a text file is a palindrome or not, if it is a palindrome it displays a message to contributor "This is a palindrome" or "This is not a palindrome".
I'm attaching link to that repository please also take a look at that.(I used ChatGPT for some commands) 
Unfortunately that action didn't work well.(I'm attaching the issue)
